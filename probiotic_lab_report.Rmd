    ## Second level heading

    ### Third-level heading

-   echo = FALSE to not print the chunkâ€™s R source code in the output document

-   warning = FALSE to not print warnings produced by the R code

-   message = FALSE to not print any messages produced by the R code

-   include = either TRUE/FALSE whether to include chunk outputs (e.g. plots) in the document

-   out.width = and out.height = - size of ouput e.g. out.width = "75%"

-   fig.align = "center" adjust how a figure is aligned across the page

-   fig.show='hold' if your chunk prints multiple figures and you want them printed next to each other (pair with out.width = c("33%", "67%")
